# Combinational-Sim

This repository contains the source code for a cycle based combinational digital circuit simulator. The program takes both a vector file and a digital circuit in .isc format. 

# Output

The program outputs a text file containing simulation results. For debugging purposes, the simulation file contains both the primary inputs applied and the simulated primary outputs. 

## Notation

The simulation results written to the file can have three possible values:

  0
  1
  2
  
 Both 0 and 1 represent a logical 0 or 1, while a 2 indicates a don't care (x).
